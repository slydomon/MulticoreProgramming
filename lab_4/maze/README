Maze library for Lab 4
by Joe Wingbermuehle
adapter by Christopher Mitchell, Ph.D.

You should be able to use maze.cc and maze.hpp as-is in your labs. Remember to seed std::rand()
using std::srand() as shown in maze-demo.cc, or else you'll be solving the same maze every time!
You may wish to create a child class of Maze capable of displaying your solution path within the maze.
